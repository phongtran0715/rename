=====> RENAME RULES <=====

I. Common rule:
Naming convention:
A-B-C-D
A = language (AR, EN, FR, ES)
B = team ((RT NG EG CT SH ST))
C = description
D = ddmmyy

- Script needs to remove illegal characters. only alphabet, numbers and underscores are allows.
- Hypen (-) should be only used as divider so not more than 4 in one name
- All spaces need to be removed
- If countries from countries.text is in filename position should change
- File name should always be ALL CAPS. lower case should be changed to uppercase

- Neglect keyword :
XX, XXX, V1, V2, V3, NA, V4, FYT, FTY, disregard, SHORT,SQ, SQUARE, SAKHR,
KHEIRA, TAREK, TABISH, ZACH, SUMMAQAH, HAMAMOU, ITANI, YOMNA, Copy, Copied (all cases)
Any 2 char abbreviation if in between -XX-
Anything attached to date should be neglected (ES-NG-INTELLIGENTBEES-070317UG.zip)
Single chracters at the end of filename (ES-RT-DISCRIMINACIOOFNCHILE-150217 4.zip)
Copy in file name or copyx copy x (ES-RT-MÈXICO-BLUEPARROT-160117 copy.zip / copy 2.zip)
Remove single_ or _single
Every combination of XX needs to be removed (XX, XX, XXX etc)
2 or more XX (XXX, XXXX, XXXXX) should be neglected

- Name can have maximum 4 x - in one name (A-B-C-D).
- A is always 2 char (AR, EN, FR,ES) B also (RT, CT etc)
and if C has more - then replace with _ as long as it ends with -DDMMYY
- Only allowed 2 chars are in the A-B part of the filename
- If there's country at the beginning , every -, _ or space needs to be removed
- Same file renames -> delete the smaller one

-------------------------------
II. Language rule:
- Script should ask on run language (A) of the files so it can append missing languages
- Wrong labels could be ARA, ESP or SPA which should change to AR (ARA) or ES (ESP, SPA)
- Just in case folder does not have a language we have to inject it.
Script needs to know what language i'll be processing. EN, AR, FR, ES by using option -l [language]
(Ex:  RT-BLABLA-DDMMYY -> AR-RT-BLABLA-DDMMYY)

-------------------------------
III. Team rule
- RT-60 should change to RT
- PL -> NG / VJ -> NG / RT-60 -> RT
- If team is absent use RT as team
- If team is absent but VJ is in filename , team should be NG
- EN-EN should be renamed to EN-EG
- Team B in A-B is never one character , always 2
- Season/Epise ('1x04')
If detect series/episode (1x07 0x1x7) etc also make sure team always is SH, never RT
when nxn is detected this is never RT but always SH.
Snxn is always seperated with _ and showname MM, TP needs to be included


-------------------------------
III. Date rule :
- ddmmyy should always be at end
- Date should always be DDMMYY 05032016 -> 050316 300615 -> 063015
- If original title has no date we should look at last opened date and add -ddmmyy


-------------------------------
IV. Script option :
- When run with -c option : show the new name without .zip (extention)
- The rule is it deletes the smallest one.
show (*** deleted *** in the list when run with -c option)

ARA-060416-XX-CT-NATOEXPLAINED  
v5: AR-RT-CTTOEXPLAINED-060416
but it's not a RT it should be CT. you do that all the time. i think the XX might cause this

it should be-> AR-CT-NATOEXPLAINED-060416


can you check the CT team rule?

ARA-060416-XX-CT-ARREST
AR-CT-ARREST-060416
correct!

ARA-060416-XX-CT-NATOEXPLAINED
AR-RT-CTTOEXPLAINED-060416
-> AR-CT-NATOEXPLAINED-060416



that will conclude the major renaming part of the script but i was wondering since you're able to get time of last access from
within th zip file. are you able to check if fit has certain folders ? looking to find the folder that has the name of the zip file

zip file name "ES-RT-COLOMBIA_ATENTADO-200217"

zip file folder structure would be something like "/mnt/restore/XXXX/XXXX/ES-RT-COLOMBIA_ATENTADO-200217"

i'm looking to see of it's possible to check if there 's a folder cuts or exports one more level down :
/mnt/restore/XXXX/XXXX/ES-RT-COLOMBIA_ATENTADO-200217/CUTS
/mnt/restore/XXXX/XXXX/ES-RT-COLOMBIA_ATENTADO-200217EXPORTS
