i noticed this one
AR-SH-SA_03X24-130717	AR-SH-S03X24-130717
AR-SH-MZ_01X04-070717	AR-SH-S01X04-070717

the original is fine. it should stay AR-SH-SA_03X24-130717 or AR-SH-MZ_01X04-070717

while you ignore a lot of 2 character abbriviation SA is a real name in combination with SH : SH-SA_
possible combinations:
AR-SH-TM_
AR-SH-ZA_
AR-SH-SA_
AR-SH-DH_
AR-SH-ESP_
AR-SH-ZA
AR-SH-TAKOL
AR-SH-ART_
AR-SH-ARTPLUS_
AR-SH-ARTPLUSDOHA_
AR-SH-MZ_
AR-SH-ST_
AR-SH-RM_
AR-SH-SA_
AR-SH-DH_

sorry i missed that earlier

if i run -c on folder could you show when files are deleted because they are smaller?

i noticed we're not neglecting everything but mov mxf and mp4
Exports/AR-RT-MATCHTHUMBNAIL-200117-CLEAN.png
Exports/AR-RT-MATCHTHUMBNAIL-200117-CLEAN.psd
Exports/AR-RT-EGYPT_ALFESEIKHTHUMBNAIL-030516-FB.jpg

we only have to grab .mov .mp4 and .mxf from cuts, cut, exports, _exports or any other folder that has 'cut' and 'exports'
please make sure to check for part of word in folder name

not sure what's going on here
AR-RT-FIFAAWARDS-090117	AR-RT-FIFAAWARDS-090117	
Exports/AR-RT-FIFAAWARDS-090117-SUB.mp4.00
Exports/AR-RT-EXOSKELETON317-090420-FINAL.mp4.01

but extension should only be as mentioned above

this one is also weird:
AR-RT-YOUTUBE-120717	AR-RT--120717
AR-RT-FACEBOOK-040517	AR-RT--040517
AR-RT-F8-190417	AR-RT--190417 <- please allow F8

Can you make sure if there's no date to grab last access date from the main folder name

Since we're close with the renaming and video extraction I want to add one more step. Moving the files based on size and first 2 characters.
Movement into folders stored in the script with path

path 'ES-folder-over-50gb'
path 'AR-folder-over-50gb'
path 'FR-folder-over-50gb'
path 'folder-everything-under-50gb'
folder 'could-not-match'

path 'ES-folder-over-50gb'
ES zip files over 50 gb need to be moved here after renaming and extraxtion

path 'AR-folder-over-50gb'
AR zip files over 50 gb need to be moved here after renaming and extraxtion

path 'EN-folder-over-50gb'
EN zip files over 50 gb need to be moved here after renaming and extraxtion

path 'folder-everything-under-50gb'
EN, AR, ES zip files under 50gb and video files need to be moved in here

folder 'could-not-match'
if an original zip file doesnt not match any of the rules move it here

in csv file i would like additional column

OLD NAME NEW NAME NEW VIDEO NAME MOVED TO

MOVED TO shows folder path name from script
